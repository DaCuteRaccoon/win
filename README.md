Everything Windows! Saves for [windows93](win93) and [windows96](win96)

## Windows 96 Saves
<s>To import the save, just download the file named `win96.zip` and import it in [windows 96][win96] in the backup menu.</s>
<br>
GitHub won't let me upload the `.zip` file (because it's too big), so I put it as a [release]. Just download it, and import it into the [windows 96][win96] backup page.
<br>
YOu can also directly view the save by going into the [win96](win96) directory.

[win96]: https://windows96.net/
[release]: https://github.com/DaCuteRaccoon/win/releases/tag/win96
