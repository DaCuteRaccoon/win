Everything Windows! Saves for [windows93](win93) and [windows96](win96)

## Windows 96 Saves
<s>To import the save, just download the file named `win96.zip` and import it in [windows 96][win96] in the backup menu.</s> GitHub won't let me upload the `.zip` file, so I put it as a `release`.
<br>
YOu can also directly view the save by going into the [win96](win96) directory.
